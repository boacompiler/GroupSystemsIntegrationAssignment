# Group Systems Integration Assignment

This is the repository for the group assignment. The work hosted here is entirely my own and not the final system.

The specification was for a 10 person team to create a hotel booking system with front and back end. The front and back end development was split into 2 teams of 5 members each, with the systems integrated upon completion.

I designed the backend and database, implemented the interface and created skeleton backend classes for peers to complete. I implemented the batch process class and acted as manager for the back end team.

The skeleton classes produced dummy data that allowed the front end team to quickly develop their system without interaction with the backend team. This allowed for asychronous development between the teams, and prevented the need for more meetings of the full 10 member team (Univesity students always seem to be busy!).

Upon completion the team and I recieved a first.
