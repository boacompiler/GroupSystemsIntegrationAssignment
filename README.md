# Group Systems Integration Assignment

This is the repository for the group assignment.

The specification was to create a hotel booking system with front end and backend.

I designed the backend and database, implemented the interface and created skeleton backend classes for peers to complete.
Unfortunately my peers did not know Git and did not complete their components till very late, resulting in this repo containing
only code I produced. The backend was fully tested
and working by submission, and the team recieved a first.
